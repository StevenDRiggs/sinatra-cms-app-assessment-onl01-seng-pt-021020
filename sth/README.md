# Seed, Time & Harvest Database (STH)

STH is a relational database that allows anyone to track seeds they have sown or will sow, harvests they have acquired, the desires they are sowing/harvesting for, and most importantly, the Scripture that ties it all together.

"Don't be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a person sows he will also reap, because the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. Let us not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don't give up." - Galatians 6:7-9, CSB
